Description:

Be honest...

Your life is a mess, and you’re in dire need of organization and self-improvement. Procrastination might as well be your middle name. But what should you do?

Well, you can deal with all that later—for now, you should play Procrastinidler. Your problems will magically disappear anyway, so why worry?

Play it at the office for all I care. The UI was designed to look like a real application, so your boss won’t suspect a thing.

How to play: Pretend you have things to do. Create tasks and complete them. If it gets too hard, hire fake people to help you out.

New Short Incremental - Procrastinidler

Hey folks,

While I (im)patiently wait for the artist to finish some key art for my other incremental, I decided to play around with a parody of a Todo App and ended up creating something I think you'll like.

It's called Procrastinidler and it's a parody Todo App where you complete fake tasks and hire assistants and a boss to help you, while getting paid for these tasks.

Lots of upgrades are available to increase your speed, efficiency and the difficulty/reward of the tasks. Play time should be around xh until you can afford the FIRE upgrade.

You can play it here: https://andre-lima.itch.io/procrastinidler

If you try it out, let me know if you had fun and what other features you want in case I decide to turn this into a longer game.
