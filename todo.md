Description:

Be honest...

Your life is a mess, and you’re in dire need of organization and self-improvement. Procrastination might as well be your middle name. But what should you do?

Well, you can deal with all that later—for now, you should play Procrastinidler. Your problems will magically disappear anyway, so why worry?

Play it at the office for all I care. The UI was designed to look like a real application, so your boss won’t suspect a thing.

How to play: Pretend you have things to do. Create tasks and complete them. If it gets too hard, hire fake people to help you out.
